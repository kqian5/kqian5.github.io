title: about | me

Born in Texas, raised in the Southeast, and living in Providence.

Currently a sophomore at [Brown University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University) concentrating in applied math-computer science. I'm particularly interested in artificial intelligence/machine learning, specifically how we can address shortcomings in these systems to make them fair, accountable, and transparent. My favorite thing about software is the challenge of learning different domains, especially as I get to dive deeper into specific topics such as neural networks or natural language. I am committed to using my skills to impact the world, because software is a big world that _anyone_ can change.

This summer, I had a great experience interning at a 3D printing company, [Encashape](http://encashape.com/). I also did some work in the [Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.brown.edu/Research/AI/blog/) at Brown University and the [Data Mining Lab](http://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu/) at Georgia State University.

In my free time you can find me on the courts practicing to be the next big NBA star, attempting the violin, or sampling different foods.

Always seeking to be inspired, to meet those who bring out the best in me, and to work hard for things worth doing.

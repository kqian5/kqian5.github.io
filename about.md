Born in Dallas, raised in Atlanta, living in Providence.

Currently a junior at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), concentrating in applied math and cs. I'm broadly interested in machine learning and its applications.

This summer, I did some full stack development at [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/). Previously, worked on 3D printing software at Encashape.

Love to read, discover new music, play basketball.

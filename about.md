Hi, welcome to my website/blog!

Born in Texas, raised in the Southeast, and living in Providence.

Currently a sophomore at [Brown University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University) concentrating in applied math-computer science. I'm particularly interested in artificial intelligence/machine learning and my favorite thing about software is the challenge of learning different domains, especially as I get to dive deeper into specific topics such as neural networks or natural language. I am a lifelong learner and am committed to using my skills to impact the world.

This summer, I had a great experience interning at a 3D printing company, [Encashape](http://encashape.com/). I also did some work in the [Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.brown.edu/Research/AI/blog/) at Brown University and the [Data Mining Lab](http://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu/) at Georgia State University.

In my free time you can find me on the courts practicing to be the next NBA star, attempting to play the violin, or sampling different foods.

Always seeking to be inspired, to meet those who bring out the best in me, and to work hard at work worth doing.

Hi, welcome to my website/blog!

I am currently a sophomore at Brown University concentrating in applied math-computer science. I'm particularly interested in artificial intelligence/machine learning and my favorite thing about software is the challenge of learning different domains, especially as I get to dive deeper into specific topics such as neural networks or natural language. I am a lifelong learner and am committed to making an impact in the world.

This summer, I had a great experience interning at a 3D printing company, Encashape. I also did some work in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at Brown University and the Data Mining Lab at Georgia State University.

In my free time you can find me on the courts practicing to be the next NBA star, attempting to play the violin, or sampling different foods.

Check out what I'm doing on [github](https://github.com/kqian5)!

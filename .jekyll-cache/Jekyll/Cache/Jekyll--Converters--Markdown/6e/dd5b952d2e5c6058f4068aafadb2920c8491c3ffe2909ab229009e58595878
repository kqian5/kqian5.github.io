<p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>

<p>This project serves as an experiment in iterative design and eye tracking analysis. My group decided to first pick a startup we found exciting, and then come up with a design for the startup without looking at any interfaces they have already built. Our choice, Listle, is a platform to listen to audio versions of stories/articles on the internet. As college students with busy schedules, we found that we often do not have enough time as desired to read news articles and publications on the internet. Listle seems to be the perfect solution for this, since it allows us to save time and enjoy content on-the-go. We chose to design a desktop application for Listle that focuses on an intuitive UI and interactive design.</p>

<p><strong><em>Initial Sketches</em></strong></p>

<p>We utilized Balsamiq to create low-fidelity mock-ups on potential interface designs for the Listle platform. Our initial sketches were very focused on being easy to learn and simple in appearance. I was inspired by various elements of interfaces that I frequently use, and chose to incorporate the static play bar from Spotify and an explore page similar to Youtube.</p>

<p><strong><em>High Fidelity Prototypes</em></strong></p>

<p>For our high fidelity prototype, we used Figma and incorporated the best concepts from each of the designs â€“ these included the navigation bar, the listening play bar, and the carousel feature. These design choices were made to  improve navigation and generate affordances. The listening play bar that would be present on all screens. We wanted to create this feature to improve ease of navigation and access, as users can quickly play, pause, or skip their current audio piece and have basic information on what they are listening to (title, author). The carousel type browsing of different audios, made the image of the central article much larger than the other audios to imply that users could click left and right to view different articles. One of our main feedback points from the critique was the issue of readability of the text on images. We improved the readability by making the text bold and increasing the transparency of the images. We also considered a hover feature where hovering over images would make the titles appear.</p>

<p><strong><em>Feedback</em></strong></p>

<p>After engaging in a critique session and an eye-tracking session, we found some areas to make additional improvements. Our changes would mainly dealt with a redesign that focuses on information hierarchy. For example, perhaps we could consider diversifying the color theme of the interface to create something more visually engaging and that would distinguish important features from the rest of the page. We can also consider how to change font sizes and style to make the page more readable and draw attention to the most important parts of the page. As far as the flow goes, the users found it intuitive and simple to use so we would keep it the way it is.</p>

<p>In addition, we also had the chance to speak with the founders of Listle! Overall, they appreciated our efforts in designing a new interface, and gave us valuable feedback regarding the information hierarchy/navigation on the home page as well.</p>

<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>

<p>I really enjoyed working iteratively with a group, which provided several opportunities to reevaluate our design and fine-tune it to achieve an optimal product. Through this process, I learned a lot about working on a front-end product from start to finish. Being able to speak with the founders of the startup was also an incredible experience that contributed to my growth.</p>

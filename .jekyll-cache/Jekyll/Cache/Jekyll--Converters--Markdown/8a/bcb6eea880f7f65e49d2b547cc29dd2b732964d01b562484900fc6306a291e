<p>Oftentimes we use products without ever thinking about its design/interface. Good design is meant to be unnoticed, which means that it serves its functional purpose well. However, bad design is quite easy to notice. For example, just imagine if your cell phone was the size of a table and unable to be held with one hand. In addition, it is important for interfaces to reflect ethical principles and remain fair, transparent, and accountable, especially as technology expands deeper and wider into the lives of more people.</p>

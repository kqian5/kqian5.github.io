I"1<p><em>redesigning a website</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>

<p>This project serves as an experiment in iterative design and eye tracking analysis. My group decided to first pick a startup we found exciting, and then come up with a design for the startup without looking at any interfaces they have already built. Our choice, Listle, is a platform to listen to audio versions of stories/articles on the internet. As college students with busy schedules, we found that we often do not have enough time as desired to read news articles and publications on the internet. Listle seems to be the perfect solution for this, since it allows us to save time and enjoy content on-the-go. We chose to design a desktop application for Listle that focuses on an intuitive UI and interactive design.</p>

I"—<p>In an eerily disturbing, yet ironic video, Obama can be seen describing the dangers of deep-fake technology. The video looks completely genuine and had I not read the title of the video, I would have been completely deceived. For the unaware, deep-fake videos are videos that are entirely generated by AI algorithms. With some of the crazy progress in technology these days such as self-driving cars and virtual assistants, this does not seem overly surprising. The rise of deep-fake technology signals that we are headed towards the end of trust in media; this trend is advanced by the recent advancement of fake news, falsified evidence, and blackmail.</p>

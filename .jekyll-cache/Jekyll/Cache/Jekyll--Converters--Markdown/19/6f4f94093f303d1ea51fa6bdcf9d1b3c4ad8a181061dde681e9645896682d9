I"•<p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>

<p>Oftentimes we use products without ever thinking about its design/interface. Good design is meant to be unnoticed, which means that it serves its functional purpose well. However, bad design is quite easy to notice. For example, just imagine if your cell phone was the size of a table and unable to be held with one hand. In addition, it is important for interfaces to reflect ethical principles and remain fair, transparent, and accountable, especially as technology expands deeper and wider into the lives of more people.</p>

<p>Here, I will provide my critique to the interface of two everyday items that could be improved, as well as give an ethical analysis of an interface according to the 18 ethical guidelines proposed by Microsoft Research.</p>

<p><strong><em>Critique 1</em></strong></p>

<p>The Hydro Flask is a sleek water bottle brand that is quite popular on college campuses. It is touted for its ability to retain a consistent temperature for long periods of time. Its appearance is quite minimal, which seems like it should be hard to find fault in its design. However, its a product that I use everyday, and there are some areas Iâ€™ve noticed that can be redesigned to improve usability, memorability, etc. In this critique, I cover some of these issues, which range from the easability of cleaning it to its unscrewable lid, and provide a newly designed Hydro Flask interface.</p>

<p><strong><em>Critique 2</em></strong></p>

<p>The dumpsters at Brown are hardly the most noticeable or impressive feature on campus, however they do serve an integral function. They are pretty good at doing their job (storing trash), but some areas could be improved in terms of the design principles. For instance, it is prone to overflowing and does not do much to nullifying the odor. In this critique, these flaws are discussed in greater detail, and a solution is proposed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ethical Analysis</em></strong></p>

<p>In this analysis, I examine the ethical implications of WeChat, the most popular social media in China. I cover a selection of principles from Microsoft Researchâ€™s guidelines for Human-AI interaction, and rate how WeChat does for each of the principles. This is especially relevant not only to users of WeChat, but also citizens of the western world since our social media companies like Facebook or Twitter are not that far off from WeChat.</p>

<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>

<p>All in all, I learned a lot about how to effectively analyze different interfaces according to different design principles after doing this project. This is important, because recognizing what is quality is the first step to becoming a better designer. After researching and thinking about several interfaces, I also realized how much the design of these interfaces influence how we interact/process information. In addition, I have become much more mindful and aware of the ethical implications of designing interfaces.</p>

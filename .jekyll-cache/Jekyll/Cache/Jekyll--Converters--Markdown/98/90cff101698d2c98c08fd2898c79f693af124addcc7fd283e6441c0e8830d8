I"/<p>I decided to start a new blog section because I figured y’all couldn’t get enough of me.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Just kidding. I wanted to be able to share and write about some of the things I find interesting, without clustering my other blog section that will solely be about tech. Here, I intend to…</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>talk about literature and music</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reflect on recent developments in the world</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>write about events in my daily life</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>peruse deep philosophical thoughts as well as simple matters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>impart knowledge in the form of how-to guides</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>present things that made me laugh</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>all of which will serve to, I hope, help you de-stress and not distress.</p>

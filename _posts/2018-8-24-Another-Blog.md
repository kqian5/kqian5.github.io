I decided to start a new blog section because I figured y'all couldn't get enough of me.

<!--more-->

Just kidding. I wanted to be able to share and write about some of the things I find interesting, without clustering my other blog section that will solely be about tech. Here, I intend to... 

- talk about literature and music

- reflect on recent developments in the world 

- write about events in my daily life

- peruse deep philosophical thoughts as well as simple matters

- impart knowledge in the form of how-to guides

- present things that made me laugh

all of which will serve to, I hope, help you de-stress and not distress.

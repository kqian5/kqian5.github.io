Can 3D printing grant immortality?
<!--more-->
Short answer: no. 

Long answer: still no. 

We may not be able to live forever, but 3D printing can certainly prolong life. There are many medical applications for 3D printing that can revolutionize healthcare. We can replicate tissues and organs. We can construct prosthetics, implants, and anatomical models. We can advance pharmaceutical research regarding drug dosage forms, delivery, and discovery. We can develop realistic organ models to allow surgeons to practice on. We can print entire babies removing the need for childbirth. Just kidding, not that last one but these advances are really quite remarkable.

### How does 3D printing work?

The printing process starts by first developing 2D image slices and stacking these 2D slices on top of one another until a product is formed in the physical world, all three dimensions of it. The materials used can range from plastics to metals to complex chemical compounds, made possible through chemical reactions liked the ones covered in your high school chemistry classes. 

With today’s technology, it is possible to convert images such as x-rays, MRI’s, and CT scans into digital 3D print files, allowing the creation of complex, customized anatomical/medical structures. This integration of 3D printing into the medical field is only natural since our own bodies are 3D and guess what? Humans have always been fascinated by their own bodies.

### What are some benefits?

One of the greatest advantages of 3D printing is the personalization of medical products, drugs and equipment. According to a recent study from the US National Library of Medicine, custom-made products such as implants, fixtures, and surgical tools can have a positive impact in terms of the time required for surgery, patient recovery time, and the success of the operation. Duh. We can easily imagine a future where patients can have their medical care personally tailored to fit their every needs. 

According to the National Health Expenditures data, the US spends more on healthcare per capita than any other country in the world. 3D printing could help combat this by making small-scale production more competitive. Companies that produce in low volumes or have products that are highly complex could rely on 3D printing technology to achieve more cost-effective and faster manufacturing. “Fast” meaning several hours. That makes 3D printing technology much faster than traditional manufacturing for items like prosthetics and implants, which require milling, forging, and long delivery times. It is common knowledge that time = money. So according to my calculations, as time decreases so does the cost involved.

One other main advantage of 3D printing is the democratization of the design and manufacturing of goods. Since more and more materials are becoming available and the costs are decreasing, people, including those in medical fields, can use little more than a 3D printer and their imaginations to design novel products for personal or commercial use. The nature of 3D printing data files also offers an unprecedented opportunity for sharing among researchers. All of these 3D printing blueprint files can be downloaded from open-source databases, where anyone can contribute. The National Institutes of Health established 3D Print Exchange in 2014 to promote open-source sharing of 3D print files for medical and anatomical models, custom labware, and replicas of proteins, viruses, and bacteria. This is a step in the right direction for sure, since collaboration is essential for progress.

### What are some potential consequences?

But like with all other things, the good comes with the bad.

3D printing can be used for criminal purposes, such as printing illegal items like guns, master keys, and ATM skimmers. Regarding the medical aspect, 3D printing can also be used to produce dangerous or counterfeit drugs. Counterfeit drugs are estimated to make up as much as 30% of medicines in some developing countries and cost legitimate pharmaceutical companies up to $200 billion per year. The Atlantic estimated that between 100,000 and 1 million consumers die every year as a result of counterfeit medicine. If 3D printing achieves the popularity that it looks like it is on track for, these numbers could rise greatly. This is bad, bad, bad.

The ease of collaboration that 3D printing allows for is especially perilous. Just like how people can collaborate to reach greater heights, they can also conspire to achieve greater evils. Defense Distributed is one such company that develops digital firearm files that are downloadable from the internet. They have been involved in a series of legal battles that most recently concluded with the legalization of 3D printable gun blueprints.

Something else to keep in mind is that unrealistic hype and expectations for a technology can stifle progress. We might lose track of what actually matters and instead focus on ephemeral gains. For instance, if we become too enraptured with the idea that 3D printing can solve organ failures through complex organ bioprinting, we might stop looking for other solutions to this problem and miss out on potentially better solutions. This is only just one small example, but for problems that are so crucial to society, it is vital that we do not limit our thinking. Either way, expectations for the potential advantages of 3D printing are often exaggerated by the media. 3D printing will require vision, money, and time to achieve its anticipated goals. While it is certain that the biomedical sector will be one of the most fertile fields for 3D printing innovations, we must recognize what has already been achieved without expecting that rapid advances toward the most sophisticated applications will occur overnight. Urgency can lead to rash decision-making and distort our sense of reality.

### How should we proceed in the future?

With 3D printing, we still face technical barriers that limit our ability to print effectively, such as hardware inconsistencies, high starting costs, output quality issues, etc. However, ethical barriers exist as well and these are arguably more important. If we cannot learn how to safely use a new technology, then it is better to not have this new technology at all. Do not mistake any form of development as forward progress.

Rather than just allowing any 3D printing file to be accessible online, we need to carefully screen for danger. The power of 3D printing allows it to essentially function as a marketplace, where people can “buy” (download and print in this case) different products, and just like any other marketplace, we should be able to choose what is available to sell. The fact that Defense Distributed won their court case over free access to 3D printing guns is indeed a huge blow to our personal safety. I cannot see any good in allowing this information to be freely available. People who are banned from buying guns can now simply buy a 3D printer and make their own. 

Perhaps we should make these 3D blueprint file types (STL files) only uploadable on certain, regulated databases or websites. This way, we can contain the spread of these such files, making oversight much more viable.

3D printing truly has the potential to change medicine and healthcare by making health care affordable, accessible and personalized. We can usher a new era if printers become more sophisticated, printing biomaterials gets safely regulated, and the general public acquires a common sense about how 3D printing works. 

The most exciting thing to me about this is the potential interactions with other new technologies in the medical field, such as AI. Soon perhaps, we can live in a world with personalized healthcare in our own homes: AI will be the doctor and 3D printing will provide the necessary infrastructure.

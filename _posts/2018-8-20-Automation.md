title: Death of the Worker
---
Losing a job to another person is pretty soul-crushing, but imagine losing a job to a machine. 

As AI becomes more advanced in the not so distant future, this imagination may soon become all too real. A study from Oxford University concluded that almost half of all U.S. jobs will be “susceptible to computerization” in the next decade or two and that an equivalent to more than a fifth of today’s global labor force could lose their jobs. AI will automate much of the jobs involving physical labor and repetitive tasks, as well as more sophisticated jobs like sales, finance, HR, accounting, marketing, and office management functions. As Stanford academic Jerry Kaplan puts it, automation is “blind to the color of your collar”.

On the other hand, there are those that believe that AI will actually create more jobs. According to an article from MIT Sloan Review, there are three main categories of jobs that will emerge: trainers, explainers, and sustainers. Trainers will teach the AI systems how to perform their tasks. Explainers are responsible for bridging the gap between technologists and business leaders, acting as consultants. Finally, sustainers will ensure that the AI systems are operating as designed and unintended consequences are addressed, managers of the ethics.

The Brookings Institute found in a study that 38% of the people surveyed think that AI will reduce jobs as compared to the 13% who thought AI would create more jobs. So, people certainly think that the future is grim.

Meanwhile, there are those with grander perspectives. Tech superstar, Elon Musk, has declared that humans must “merge with machines” to not become irrelevant. Perhaps being a billionaire enlightens you with brilliant insights, but it is more likely that he sees big $$$ in this.

### So what is the truth?

No one can say for sure but I for one will confidently venture that AI will not be the end of civilization, as some people are saying. There have been plenty of technological innovations in the past that have led to displacement in jobs, yet the human race has only seen prosperity in the long term.

Hunter gatherers faced unemployment when better farming was invented. The industrial revolution led to losses of jobs as manufacturing became more efficient. Concerns for technological unemployment have been growing recently, but a majority of economists agree that technology is unlikely to lead to long-term unemployment.

An interesting thing to note is whether these robots will learn to pick up the intricate nature of humans: the happiness, the love, the pain, the empathy. Certain jobs seem to require human judgement that is hard to program into robots. Machines might be great at processing complex mathematical problems, organizing spreadsheets, and carrying mundane tasks at lightning speeds. What they aren’t so good at is understanding people, forming human connections, reacting quickly in unfamiliar situations. So, jobs like teachers, doctors, care workers seem secure for the time being. If anything, AI will be used to support these roles and to make the lives of these teachers, doctors, care workers easier.

It is also safe to assume that programmers will not have to worry about losing their job anytime soon. After all, they are the ones responsible for designing all the robots for replacing us. But it is curious to think about what happens when we learn to develop robots who can program, an idea already under study. After all, AI can already beat humans in board games, make medical discoveries, compose songs, paint art, etc. Why shouldn’t they be able to program?

If you ever hear about the glass half-full/half-empty scenario, just remember that the glass is refillable. So, while in the short-term we may lose some jobs, new jobs will arise to take these places in the long run. A culture of continuous learning is how we will deal with short-term loss and rebuild for tomorrow. The human race has repeatedly shown that it can adapt and rise to serve the needs of new technologies. As futurist Peter Schwartz puts it “new technologies turn the luxuries of the past into the needs of the present, and it requires labor to support those new necessities.”

So, the worker may die, but the researcher, the tester, the engineer, the product manager will rise up in its place.

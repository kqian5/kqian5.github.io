***Introduction***

A computer shell is perhaps one of my most commonly used applications, and it’s always been something I’ve taken for granted. There’s something fundamental about it, as if its existed since the dawn of computers. As part of my computer systems course, I designed a shell application that allows users to run different commands, change between foreground and background processes, and interact with different files. It honestly was a monumental project that really helped me understand some of the more important topics of computer science (multi-threading, optimization, low-level programming), and gave me a greater appreciation for our current technological achievements.


***Parsing and Handling User Input***

The first step of the project was to handle different commands from the user, using a REPL. I took in user input in the form of a buffer and had to validate/clean this input. Then, I would check the first argument in this input for builtin commands like "cd", "ln", and ​"rm". If none of these were used, I forked to create a child process that executed the custom command. If necessary, I would then redirect files, which involved opening/closing different file descriptors for use when calling “execv”. In my first implementation, the shell could not handle multiple processes so the shell would wait until the single process finished before moving onto the next iteration of the REPL.

***Adding Multiple Process Functionality***

 The next step was to handle multiple processes at once. To implement this, I added functionality for starting a new process in a different thread and used “waitpid” to wait for these different processes to finish, depending on if the forked process was foreground or background. To send a process to the background, I had to check the command line for special arguments like “&” and “bg” and then ensured that the shell did not wait on these processes. I also had to consider reaping background processes after they finished running in the background. Finally, I added signal listeners to catch and deal with different signals like “ctrl-c” and “ctrl-d” appropriately.

***Interesting Challenges***
    
 As with all CS projects, there were multiple challenges that came up in the development process. One particular noteworthy example was figuring out where/when to send particular signals. The idea is that after we read in user input, we check if it is a foreground or a background process. Then inside of the fork, we set all of our signals back to default. If it is a foreground process, the signal target is set to the foreground process. Then after the fork, if it is a background process, we add it to the jobs list. If it is a foreground process, we call waitpid and wait for a change of state. Finally, we set the signal target back to the shell. Messing up the order of operations of this sequence results in a series of bugs that are very hard to resolve.

***Conclusion***

 The end result of a month of hardships endured was an interactive shell that was capable of running basic commands and multiple processes. I am especially proud of the effort I put in and view this moment as a key milestone in my CS education. My technical skills grew as I got better with low-level programming in C, but so did my soft skills with all of the interactions with my peers and course staff covering various shell-related concepts.
